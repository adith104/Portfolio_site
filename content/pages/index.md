    subtitle: Software Engineer | Cloud Solutions & Machine Learning Specialist
    text: >+

      I am a seasoned software engineer with a strong focus on cloud
      architecture and machine learning. At Rheem Manufacturing, I developed
      scalable data-driven applications, optimizing IoT data processing and
      creating advanced analytics dashboards. My work at AI4CE Lab, NYU,
      involves cutting-edge AI research, where I leverage deep learning
      frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch to solve complex problems. With a
      passion for combining software engineering principles with AI, I aim to
      deliver innovative solutions that drive business growth and efficiency.

          I am contributing to the **OpenFAST software development** on the
          computer science side, focusing on enhancing simulation capabilities
          for offshore wind energy systems. My role involves optimizing and
          integrating computational models to improve the performance of wind
          turbines in dynamic ocean environments. By working with complex
          codebases and simulations, I’m helping drive innovations in renewable
          energy through advanced software solutions.

          As a course assistant for both graduate (CS-GY 6923) and undergraduate
          (CS-UY 4563) Machine Learning courses, I assist in preparing course
          materials, grading assignments, and providing support to students
          during office hours. I collaborate with professors to ensure students
          grasp key concepts in machine learning, deep learning, and algorithmic
          problem-solving. Additionally, I help facilitate discussions, explain
          complex topics, and guide students through hands-on coding exercises
          and projects.

          As a research assistant, I developed a **review-based group
          recommender system** using deep learning techniques, including CNN and
          attention mechanisms. My research aimed to improve recommendation
          accuracy by leveraging user reviews, focusing on group decision-making
          dynamics. This work involved extensive experimentation with neural
          networks, data preprocessing, and model optimization, contributing to
          advancements in personalized recommendation systems.
